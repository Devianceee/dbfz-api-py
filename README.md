# dbfz-api-py
 Async library for interfacing with the replay REST API of Dragonball FighterZ. 
 
Massively inspired by [Felix Windstr√∂m's](https://twitter.com/sov_gott_games/) creation of http://ratingupdate.info/.

Please keep in mind this is a Python implementation of dealing with the API. Depending on how Messagepack is done on your preferred language, some aspects may change.

## How the API works
The API works by sending a POST request to https://dbf.channel.or.jp/api/catalog/get_replay. 
The header needs to contain ```Content Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded``` as you need to pass a hex (non-escaped) encoded messagepack to the server.

The server will then give a response back in hex encoded messagepack which can be unpacked.

The request for the replay requires having a **very** specific timestamp(?) which is in hex, this can be gotten by using sending a POST request to https://dbf.channel.or.jp/api/user/login. Follows the same suite as above.
## Headers
```python
headers = {
    "Host": "dbf.channel.or.jp",
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
}
```

These are the only headers needed for sending a request to the API endpoints

## Making request
### JSON Structure for login_url
```python
[
    [
        "", 
        "", 
        2,
        "0.0.3", 
        3
    ],
    [
        "76561198077238939",
        "110000106f8de9b", 
        256, 
        0
    ]
]
```

The workflow for sending to api is:
1) Get json and pack to msgpack
2) Add to another json and add to the key "data", and transform the escaped hex to hex. For example: ```binascii.hexlify(msgpack.packb(loginData))```
3) POST to the api as ```data=``` and response will be plaintext msgpack to be decoded using ```msgpack.unpackb()```

After, you get a response from the server such as the following:
```python
[
    [
        "636d55d3a3736",
        0,
        "2022/11/11 04:49:39",
        "0.0.3",
        "0.0.3",
        "0.0.3",
        "",
        ""
    ],
    [
        0,
        [
            "180205073302944623",
            "Deviance",
            "76561198077238939",
            "110000106f8de9b",
            869826
        ]
    ]
]
```
Which you take the first value (in the example above would be ```636d55d3a3736```) and put that into the JSON for the get_replay_url below.

### JSON Structure for get_replay_url
```python
[
  [
    "180205073302944623", # player ID doing request
    timestamp(), # timestamp which is taken from the login_url request as shown above
    2, # unknown
    "0.0.3", # game version
    3 # unknown, probably platform such as PC and PS4
  ],
  [
    7, # unknown
    1, # order by [1: newest, 2: views, etc]
    0, # number of replay pages scrolled (starts at 0), max is 50000 upwards but gets very slow so best to stick to 5000 or less
    10, # number of matches queried, can be more than 10000
    [
      28, # unknown
      -1, # character list, [all character: -1, ssj goku: 0, ssj vegeta: 1, etc] always goes upwards (easy to make enum)
      102, # query for play mode, [all modes: -1 , ranked: 102 , casual: 104, arena: 103, ring: 105, ring party match: 107, tournament: 110]
      1, # queries from this number downwards up to 10 ranks (starts at 1), can go up to 50000 upwards but gets very slow so best to stick to 5000 or less
      -1, # unknown
      []
    ]
  ]
]
```

### Workflow to Send Request
The workflow for sending to api is:
1) Get json and pack to msgpack
2) Add to another json and add to the key "data", and transform the escaped hex to hex. For example: ```binascii.hexlify(msgpack.packb(replayData))```
3) POST to the api as ```data=``` and response will be plaintext msgpack to be decoded using ```msgpack.unpackb()```

OR
1) Get msgpack data (such as ```9295b2313830323035303733333032393434363233ad3633356661306433313734303802a5302e302e3303950701000a961cffff01ff90```)
2) Add to another json and add to the key "data"
3) POST to the api as ```data=``` and response will be plaintext msgpack to be decoded using ```msgpack.unpackb()```


## Parsing response
### Converting from Messagepack to JSON
You can unpack the messagepack using ```msgpack.unpackb()```, however each item in the JSON will be encoded so manually decoding 
via the functions provided (```decode_list``` and subsequently ```decode_dict```) helps it be parsed as a json

### JSON Structure

The JSON always has 10 matches inside it with the first player always being the winner. A shortened example with only one match is annotated below:
```python
[
    [
        "6365b7aff20b5",
        0,
        "2022/11/05 10:09:03", # time it was queried in JST (irrelevant to the actual match stats)
        "0.0.3",
        "0.0.3",
        "0.0.3",
        "",
        ""
    ],
    [

        10,

                28,
                "WIN_RkmRVer028",
                [ # characters for player who won
                    0,
